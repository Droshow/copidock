# 🪄 Copidock — Context Rehydration CLI for Developers & AI Creators (Beta)

> **AI + Infra + Human Memory → One Flow**

In the era when AI develops code, we need to treat prompts like git.

Copidock turns your development state into something you can **save, rehydrate, and continue later** — like a snapshot of your mental model.  
When you run a snapshot command, it collects your goal, reasoning, and relevant code, and turns it into a structured **rehydratable document** (PRD-style).  
Later, you or another developer can "rehydrate" that snapshot and pick up where it left off — no lost context, no guessing.

## 🌍 Why This Scaffolding Exists

We're building a **serverless note and context management system** powered by:
- AWS **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, and **S3**
- Terraform-based IaC deployment
- AI-guided context synthesis and rehydration

Each snapshot bridges **prompt engineering** and **software state management**.  
It captures:
- **Who** — persona (e.g., Cloud Infra Engineer, Backend Dev)
- **What** — goal, focus, expected outputs
- **When/Where** — commit, repo, branch
- **How** — reasoning and operator instructions

## ⚙️ Core Commands

### 1. Create a new snapshot

Generate a rehydratable snapshot of your current thread and codebase:

```bash
copidock snapshot create --comprehensive --hydrate
```

This will:
- Gather recent Git context
- Generate a PRD-style markdown file
- Upload it to S3 for future rehydration
- Save a local copy under `copidock/rehydrations/`

### 2. Interactive mode (recommended)

For structured guidance and persona loading:

```bash
copidock snapshot create --interactive --stage initial --comprehensive --hydrate
```

- `--stage initial` → Greenfield / PRD setup template
- `--stage development` → Ongoing implementation template
- `--comprehensive` → Includes Git diffs, file snippets, and commits
- `--hydrate` → Uploads snapshot + updates local index

**Note:** Use `--stage development` when continuing an existing project where you want to track git changes and file modifications. Use `--stage initial` for greenfield projects or when you want a clean template without git context.

### 3. Rehydrate from saved snapshots

```bash
# List available snapshots
copidock rehydrate list

# Restore latest snapshot
copidock rehydrate restore LATEST

# Restore specific snapshot
copidock rehydrate restore 20241102-143022-pomodoro-app
```

---

## 🧠 Two-Button Workflow

### Start a thread
```bash
copidock thread start "Implement Pomodoro App Infrastructure"
```

### Create a snapshot
```bash
copidock snapshot create --comprehensive --hydrate
```

**Result:** a portable `.md` snapshot that stores your entire development reasoning — rehydratable anytime.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Overview

Built for reproducibility and scalability.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Storage** | S3 buckets for snapshots, logs, and assets |
| **Database** | DynamoDB tables for threads, events, and notes |
| **Compute** | AWS Lambda functions as stateless handlers |
| **API** | API Gateway fronting the serverless endpoints |
| **Infra** | Managed via Terraform for full IaC reproducibility |

Deploy with:
```bash
cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## 💬 Developer Notes

- Copidock is currently in **Beta** — expect structure changes.
- Focus for now: snapshot creation, hydration, and state integrity.
- Avoid checking in internal Copidock files.

Add this to your `.gitignore`:
```gitignore
# Copidock
copidock/rehydrations/
.copidock/state.json
```

## 🧩 Philosophy

> "AI doesn't replace reasoning — it remembers it."

Copidock externalizes your working memory so you can:

- **Pause** a task, switch context, and resume later without losing your train of thought.
- **Share** project reasoning with teammates through portable, rehydratable documents.
- **Combine** reproducible infrastructure with semantic intent — Terraform for systems, Copidock for minds.

---

## ⚡ Summary

- **Purpose** → Persistent context for human + AI collaboration
- **Core Command** → `copidock snapshot create --comprehensive --hydrate`
- **Infra** → Serverless (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway)
- **State** → Locally cached + S3 synchronized
- **Status** → Beta — focus on stability, snapshot logic, and rehydration accuracy

## 🤝 Contributing

For early collaborators testing snapshot and rehydrate flows locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd copidock
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Test locally**
   ```bash
   copidock thread start "Test thread"
   copidock snapshot create --hydrate
   copidock rehydrate list
   ```

4. **Report issues**
   - Focus on snapshot accuracy and rehydration consistency
   - Test across different project stages and personas
   - Verify local artifact management works correctly

Now that the backend is tested and solid, you’ve got two natural next steps:

Developer UX polish (Phase 3):

Write a CLI wrapper (copidock command) to hide the curl messiness.

Commands like:

copidock thread start "Deploy Phase 3 infra"
copidock note add "Reminder: update Lambda IAM role"
copidock snapshot add --paths infra/main.tf lambdas/*
copidock rehydrate latest


This keeps the workflow git-like and smooth.

IDE integration (Phase 4):

Start lightweight with a VS Code extension that just surfaces:

“Start thread”

“Add note”

“Snapshot current context”

For now, it can just shell out to the CLI or hit your API.

The Issue: Rehydration Display
You're absolutely right! The rehydrate command doesn't know how to display the comprehensive synthesis sections. It's only showing the old basic format.

The Solution
Your template system is generating perfect content but it's stored in the synthesis sections that the basic rehydrate command doesn't know how to display.

You need to either:

Update the rehydrate command to display comprehensive synthesis sections
Use the debug output (which shows the template content perfectly)
Create a new command like copidock rehydrate comprehensive

Next Session Goals
Add backend hydration endpoints (Lambda handlers)

*** DONE *** 

** TODO ** 
Test complete hydrate → S3 → rehydrate flow
📋 Next Session Goals:
Complete the Testing
Fix S3 file location issue - Find where rehydration files are actually stored
Test complete S3 → Rehydrate flow - Get the retrieval working
Test PM persona - Fix missing template variables in product-manager.yml
Polish rehydrate display - Handle comprehensive synthesis sections properly
The Big Picture Achievement 🚀
Your "Development Assistant as a Service" is essentially complete:

✅ Multi-role support (PM, Developer, DevOps personas)
✅ Intelligent context detection (file analysis, commit patterns)
✅ Role-appropriate guidance (stakeholder language vs. technical tasks)
✅ Persistent context (hydrate → S3 → rehydrate architecture)
✅ Serverless architecture (Lambda + API Gateway + S3 + DynamoDB)


Fix PM persona loading (still showing "Developer" instead of "Product Manager")
Polish the PM experience (less git-oriented, more stakeholder-focused)

===============================================================================
The Big Picture Achievement
You've built a true multi-role development assistant where:

PMs get stakeholder language and business tasks
Developers get code-focused guidance and technical tasks
DevOps gets infrastructure language and deployment tasks
All using the same intelligent underlying system
Your "Development Assistant as a Service" vision is essentially complete on the CLI side! The template system is intelligent, the CLI is comprehensive, and the architecture is clean.

Now that the backend is tested and solid, you’ve got two natural next steps:

Developer UX polish (Phase 3):

Write a CLI wrapper (copidock command) to hide the curl messiness.

Commands like:

copidock thread start "Deploy Phase 3 infra"
copidock note add "Reminder: update Lambda IAM role"
copidock snapshot add --paths infra/main.tf lambdas/*
copidock rehydrate latest


This keeps the workflow git-like and smooth.

IDE integration (Phase 4):

Start lightweight with a VS Code extension that just surfaces:

“Start thread”

“Add note”

“Snapshot current context”

For now, it can just shell out to the CLI or hit your API.

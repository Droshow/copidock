Now that the backend is tested and solid, you’ve got two natural next steps:

Developer UX polish (Phase 3):

Write a CLI wrapper (copidock command) to hide the curl messiness.

Commands like:

copidock thread start "Deploy Phase 3 infra"
copidock note add "Reminder: update Lambda IAM role"
copidock snapshot add --paths infra/main.tf lambdas/*
copidock rehydrate latest


This keeps the workflow git-like and smooth.

IDE integration (Phase 4):

Start lightweight with a VS Code extension that just surfaces:

“Start thread”

“Add note”

“Snapshot current context”

For now, it can just shell out to the CLI or hit your API.

The Issue: Rehydration Display
You're absolutely right! The rehydrate command doesn't know how to display the comprehensive synthesis sections. It's only showing the old basic format.

The Solution
Your template system is generating perfect content but it's stored in the synthesis sections that the basic rehydrate command doesn't know how to display.

You need to either:

Update the rehydrate command to display comprehensive synthesis sections
Use the debug output (which shows the template content perfectly)
Create a new command like copidock rehydrate comprehensive
